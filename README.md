## About the Workshop

The CLEAR-AI Workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to address transparency in AI systems through collaborative and participatory approaches. Below you'll find more details about the workshop's focus, submission guidelines, and how to participate.

## Background
As AI systems become integral to critical decision-making processes, ensuring their transparency, fairness, and accountability is more essential than ever. Therefore, it is not surprising that the AI Act, the world's first attempt to systematically regulate artificial intelligence, places significant emphasis on this need. In particular, the Act establishes transparency as a fundamental principle, aiming to safeguard user rights and foster trust and reliability in new technologies. In this context, transparency assumes a salient value as a prerequisite for ensuring the fair and responsible development and deployment of AI.

Achieving these objectives necessitates not only the establishment of robust technical frameworks but also the active engagement of a diverse range of stakeholders to ensure that the development of AI is aligned with societal values. In this regard, interdisciplinary research and implementation initiatives have been identified as crucial to facilitate progress in this area.

Following from this, the workshop focuses on advancing the design, monitoring, and evaluation of transparent AI systems. By combining participatory approaches that amplify stakeholder voices with formal methodologies that ensure rigour and reproducibility, the workshop aims to advance the state of the art in trustworthy AI, bridging technical and social perspectives.

The CLEAR-AI Workshop addresses the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration to advance methods, tools, and evaluation frameworks that ensure transparency, fairness, and trustworthiness in AI systems. In addition, specific focus is put on tackling the challenges emerging from the participatory setting. Submissions should emphasize the integration of technical rigour with societal relevance to address the challenges of building trustworthy AI systems. The CLEAR-AI Workshop aligns with ECAI 2025's mission of advancing sustainable AI by promoting transparency, participatory approaches, and rigorous methods that ensure accountability and societal alignment.



## Problem Description
Transparency takes up a central instrumental role in addressing and understanding a wide range of problems from legal to ethical in AI development and deployment. Yet, transparency is often a vague and hard to pin down notion from a objective perspective and is defined differently on different levels in the understanding of AI systems.

In CLEAR we want to approach the problem from the direction of *stakeholder needs* on transparency. By understanding the needs for information we can work to concretely meet these demands. 

The needs on transparency can come from many different sources, such as legal understanding and effective user agency, as such any workable method for this will have to address the participatory aspect of eliciting these needs from the stakeholders.

## Topics of Interest
The workshop welcomes contributions on topics including, but not limited to:
- Innovative methodologies for designing transparent AI systems for meeting stakeholder needs
- Tools, metrics, and techniques for monitoring and ensuring transparency in AI
- Transparency risk assessments
- Participatory design and co-creation methodological approaches involving diverse stakeholders
- Formal frameworks for evaluating transparency
- Case studies and best practices for transparent AI in real-world applications
- Knowledge elicitation methods during participatory settings for AI transparency
- Conceptual translation among stakeholders from diverse backgrounds
- Legal transparency requirements

Submissions should emphasize the integration of technical rigour with societal relevance to address the challenges of building trustworthy AI systems. 

Perspectives on the above issues from under-represented countries are particularly welcome.

## Challenges and Workshop perspective

### Challenge 1. Reframing Transparency as a Relation, Not a Static Property

Transparency is too often treated as something systems have rather than something they provide in relation to those who use, audit, or are affected by them.
This theme challenges us to rethink transparency as an active relation between information and its audience, asking what kinds of transparency actually reach and serve their intended stakeholders. Taking a step back this theme pushes us to reflect about the stakeholders behind the system design and their agency through the system.


### Challenge 2. Connecting Methods to Meaning and Purpose

Technical tools and conceptual models for transparency abound, but they often operate without a clear sense of for whom and for what they exist.
This theme explores how metrics, explanations, and frameworks can be oriented toward concrete purposes—whether legal accountability, informed oversight, or effective user understanding—rather than remaining abstract or self-referential.
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ### Challenge 3. Moving Toward Stakeholder-Centered Transparency

The ultimate challenge remains to make transparency usable, relevant, and responsive.
This theme looks at how today’s methods can evolve—through participatory, methodological, or institutional innovation—toward transparency that genuinely empowers those who depend on it.

## Target Audience
The CLEAR-AI Workshop targets an interdisciplinary audience, including:
- Researchers and practitioners in AI, machine learning, and data science
- Experts in human-computer interaction and participatory design
- Ethicists, policymakers, and legal professionals focusing on AI governance
- Developers and engineers working on tools and frameworks for AI transparency
- Stakeholders from academia, industry, and civil society interested in AI transparency
